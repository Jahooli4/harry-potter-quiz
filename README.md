# Harry Potter Quiz âš¡

[Live site](https://jahooli4.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/index.html)

The Harry Potter Quiz is a fun game for fans who wish to test their knowledge on wizarding world trivia. The questions are based on a combination of the books and films. 

The user is invited to select their Hogwarts house which will change the background colour of the game based on their choice.

The user can then select from three levels of difficulty: easy, medium or difficult. This ensures that the game is inclusive to all players, whether the user is new to the series or a long time fan.
