# Harry Potter Quiz âš¡

[Live site](https://jahooli4.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/index.html)

The Harry Potter Quiz is a fun game for fans who wish to test their knowledge on wizarding world trivia. The questions are based on a combination of the books and films. 

The user is invited to select their Hogwarts house which will change the background colour of the game based on their choice.

The user can then select from three levels of difficulty: easy, medium or difficult. This ensures that the game is inclusive to all players, whether the user is new to the series or a long time fan.

The site has been designed to be as user friendly as possible, utilising a classic layout style with the title/logo at the top that links to the home page, central main content, and footer with external social media links at the bottom. The layout has been made as consistent as possible across devices of different sizes, with elements only rearranging to provide optimised viewing.

### Surface plane

**Color**
With regards to the main colour scheme of the site I have decided to opt for the classic red, green, blue and yellow colours of the Hogwarts houses for the optional background colours, aswell as for the answer selection buttons. To ensure these colours pop I have chosen a classic purple colour for the background as I think this allows sufficient contrast without being aesthetically jarring.
> - #fafafa (white)
> - #800080 (purple)
> - #eeba30 (yellow)
> - #0041c2 (blue)
> - #b22222 (red)
> - #198754 (green)

**Font:**
The main font for the quiz will be "Old Standard TT" and for the main page title/logo and other smaller headings I will use "MedievalSharp" as this is the closest I could find to the fonts used on the Harry Potter book covers. I think the two fonts complement eachother nicely and are easily legible.

## Existing Features

> - Footer section

Minimal in design so as not to distract from the main quiz. I have included basic social media links in a place that is intuitive to the user.

## Future Features
### Home page
> - I would like to include some sort of animation on page load to add a more 3d feel to the site.
### Quiz section
> - Given more time I would like to add some sort of audio when the user selects an answer, with different noises based on whether the answer is correct or not.
### Additional pages
> - In the future I would plan to add a leaderboard feature that would allow users to create a username and appear on a page of high scorers.
