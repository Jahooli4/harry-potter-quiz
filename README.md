# Harry Potter Quiz âš¡

[Live site](https://jahooli4.github.io/harry-potter-quiz/index.html)

The Harry Potter Quiz is a fun game for fans who wish to test their knowledge on wizarding world trivia. The questions are based on a combination of the books and films. 

The user is invited to select their Hogwarts house which will change the background colour of the game based on their choice.

The user can then select from three levels of difficulty: easy, medium or difficult. This ensures that the game is inclusive to all players, whether the user is new to the series or a long time fan.

The site has been designed to be as user friendly as possible, utilising a classic layout style with the title/logo at the top that links to the home page, central main content, and footer with external social media links at the bottom. The layout has been made as consistent as possible across devices of different sizes, with elements only rearranging to provide optimised viewing.

### Surface plane

**Color**
With regards to the main colour scheme of the site I have decided to opt for the classic red, green, blue and yellow colours of the Hogwarts houses for the optional background colours, aswell as for the answer selection buttons. To ensure these colours pop I have chosen a classic purple colour for the background as I think this allows sufficient contrast without being aesthetically jarring.
> - #fafafa (white)
> - #800080 (purple)
> - #eeba30 (yellow)
> - #0041c2 (blue)
> - #b22222 (red)
> - #198754 (green)

Colour palette generated from coolors.co

**Font:**
The main font for the quiz will be "Old Standard TT" and for the main page title/logo and other smaller headings I will use "MedievalSharp" as this is the closest I could find to the fonts used on the Harry Potter book covers. I think the two fonts complement eachother nicely and are easily legible.

## Existing Features
> - Title/logo

Linked to homepage so user may refresh the quiz whenever they please, visible throughout the quiz.

> - House selection

User is invited to select their Hogwarts house of choice.

![Landing page screenshot](assets/images/readme/landing-page.png)

The background and logo change colour accordingly using JS.

![Level selection page showing diferent background colour examples](assets/images/readme/level-page.png)

User can then choose level difficulty for the quiz from the buttons.

> - Quiz questions and answers

Questions are pulled from the relevant array (easy, medium, difficult).

Answer buttons highlight when hovered over (large devices) to create positive UX.

Score increments +1 with every correct answer, scored out of the current question number (score/question number)

After user has selected an answer, the alert box appears to let user knopw whether their choice was correct or not.

> - Endgame page 

After 10 questions in any of the levels, the user's score is displayed with the relevent message based on how well they did.

The 'play again' button appears to invite the user to attempt another level.

![Endgame screenshot](assets/images/readme/endgame-screenshot.png)

> - Footer section

Minimal in design so as not to distract from the main quiz. I have included basic social media links in a place that is intuitive to the user.

## Future Features
### Home page
> - I would like to include some sort of animation on page load to add a more 3d feel to the site.
### Quiz section
> - Given more time I would like to add some sort of audio when the user selects an answer, with different noises based on whether the answer is correct or not.
### Additional pages
> - In the future I would plan to add a leaderboard feature that would allow users to create a username and appear on a page of high scorers.

## Bugs: 

> - I had trouble with the bootstrap buttons I was using to display the answer choices. For some reason the hover effect lingered on mobile devices, meaning the previously selected answer remained highlighted even when the next question was displayed. 
> - As this was only happening on touch devices I decided to add a media query that removes the hover effect on anything smaller than a large device.
